I managed to upload this project to vercel with no issues, fixing the SQL trailing comma, used npm i react-icons and npm audit fix --force. I changed my github app url and callback url to work with the vercel url. Additionally, I completed the stretch goal of adding the title of the post to the metadata title, allowing the user to see the post they are on from the tab.

I found no issues with this project, however I did find that there was an error when uploaded to vercel that when you logged in it gave a 404 unless you refreshed the page. Frankie found that this was an error due to it being a serverside component, so I switched it to a client side component using the docs here:  https://authjs.dev/getting-started/session-management/login. This fixed the issue.

Furthermore, there seems to be a classwide issue: When a persons page reaches around 3/4 posts (we think this is the factor causing this issue, we have tested extensively and narrowed it down to this, we do not think it is ISP (I tested with a VPN) and it is nothing to do with posts created on localhost to vercel (we tested this by wiping databases) and it is not a single persons issue but rather almost everyones issue) the server gets a 405 error and that persons server is no longer available.
