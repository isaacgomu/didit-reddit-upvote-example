I managed to upload this project to vercel with no issues, fixing the SQL trailing comma, used npm i react-icons and npm audit fix --force. I changed my github app url and callback url to work with the vercel url. 

I found no issues with this project, however I did find that there was an error when uploaded to vercel that when you logged in it gave a 404 unless you refreshed the page. Frankie found that this was an error due to it being a serverside component, so I switched it to a client side component using the docs here:  https://authjs.dev/getting-started/session-management/login. This fixed the issue.
